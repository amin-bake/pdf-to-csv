## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-02

### 🎉 Microservices Architecture Implementation

Migrated application from monolithic Flask to modern microservices architecture with Next.js frontend.

### Added

#### Frontend (Next.js 15 + TypeScript)
- **Modern UI Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom design system
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support with system detection and theme toggle
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Query for server state
- **File Upload**: Enhanced drag-and-drop with real-time progress tracking
- **Status Tracking**: Visual file cards with status badges (uploading, uploaded, converting, completed, error)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design that works on all devices

#### Backend Microservices
- **Upload Service (Port 5001)**: 
  - File upload with validation (PDF, 50MB max)
  - UUID-based file identification
  - Health check endpoint
  - CORS support for frontend integration

- **Conversion Service (Port 5002)**:
  - PDF to CSV conversion with pdfplumber
  - Background job processing with threading
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Table extraction with merge support
  - Fallback to text extraction
  - Job status polling API

- **Download Service (Port 5003)**:
  - Single file download
  - Batch download as ZIP with original filenames preserved
  - File metadata endpoints
  - Cleanup operations

#### Infrastructure
- **Docker Compose**: Full development environment setup
- **Shared Libraries**: Common utilities and storage abstraction
- **Environment Configuration**: Service-specific environment variables
- **Health Checks**: All services expose health endpoints

### Changed

#### Architecture
- **Microservices Pattern**: Separated concerns into independent services
- **API Communication**: RESTful APIs with CORS support
- **File Storage**: Shared temporary storage with job-based organization
- **Progress Tracking**: Polling-based status updates (WebSocket support planned)

#### User Experience
- **Smart Downloads**: Single file downloads as CSV, multiple files as ZIP
- **Original Filenames**: Preserved in ZIP archives
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual progress bars and status indicators
- **Error Handling**: Per-file error tracking and display
- **Theme Support**: Light, dark, and system theme options

#### Development
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend
- **Modern React**: Hooks, async operations, and optimistic updates
- **API Client**: Centralized API communication layer
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic for upload, conversion, and download

### Fixed

- File status updates now properly track from upload through conversion
- Download functionality correctly routes to Download Service (was trying port 5000)
- Individual file downloads now work alongside batch downloads
- ZIP archives preserve original filenames (was using file IDs)
- Theme toggle icon properly changes color on hover

### Technical Details

#### Frontend Stack
- Next.js 15.5.6 with App Router
- React 19 with TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui + Radix UI
- Zustand + React Query
- Lucide React icons

#### Backend Stack
- Flask 3.0.0
- pdfplumber 0.11.8 for PDF parsing
- Python 3.11+
- In-memory job tracking
- Temporary file system storage

#### Deployment
- Frontend: Ready for Vercel deployment
- Services: Containerized with Docker
- Local development: npm run dev (starts all services)
- Production: docker-compose with environment-specific configs

### Migration Status

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Project restructuring and documentation
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Frontend development with Next.js 15 + dark mode
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Backend microservices (Upload, Conversion, Download)
- 📋 **Phase 4**: Storage & Infrastructure improvements (S3, Redis)
- 📋 **Phase 5**: Testing & Documentation
- 📋 **Phase 6**: Production deployment & monitoring

### Breaking Changes

- **API Endpoints**: New service-specific URLs (5001, 5002, 5003)
- **Environment Variables**: New `NEXT_PUBLIC_*_SERVICE_URL` variables required
- **File IDs**: Now use UUIDs instead of timestamp-based IDs
- **Response Format**: Updated JSON structure for consistency

### Deprecated

- ❌ Legacy monolithic Flask app (moved to `/legacy` folder)
- ❌ Old API at port 5000
- ❌ In-app UI from Flask templates (replaced with Next.js)
